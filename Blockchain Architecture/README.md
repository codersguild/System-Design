## Dear Blockchain Engineer

- Read and get a fair understanding of the Bitcoin whitepaper. The next is a bit daunting but do it in your free time, clone the Bitcoin repo and go over 
the source code, see if you can co-relate with paper and code in the repo. 
- Learn Solidity Programming Language and move to truffle or brownie based systems for easy code, build and testing infrastructure. 
- [Advanced] Give a through read to Ethereum white paper. Understand EVM, stack, bytecode, gas computation. 
- There are a few standards that one must be aware of, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards are absolutely necessary. 
- Learn about the Byzantine Generals Problem and how it was solved. Learn about consensus problem and ask `Is Blockchain necessary?` when you encounter a similar problem?
- Proof of Work is absolutely necessary, Proof-of-stake nom nom. 
- YOU ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE HODLED CRYPTO OR BE A MILLIONAIRE, but if are into it you have my deepest appreciations. (Has technology made you money other than it being in the form of salary? Done for me!). This gives a bigger reason to know the underlying technology and make rational decisions.
